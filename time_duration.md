To calculate the time duration of the data sample:

1. **Sampling frequency**: 1000 Hz (1000 samples per second)
2. **Number of samples**: 38,400

The total duration \( T \) in seconds is calculated as:  
\[
T = \frac{\text{Number of samples}}{\text{Sampling frequency}}
\]
\[
T = \frac{38400}{1000} = 38.4 \, \text{seconds}
\]

Thus, the time duration of the data sample is **38.4 seconds**.
